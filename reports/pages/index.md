## About this site

This site is a sandbox for exploring open source data applications and tooling. It is built with [Evidence](https://evidence.dev), a code-forward analytics platform for data teams, and is powered by [dbt](https://getdbt.com), the industry-standard control plane for data transformation, and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), a high-performance embeddable analytical database. Specifically, the production deployment of this site gets data from [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/), a cloud warehouse built on DuckDB, but this project can run completely locally on your machine or a devcontainer.
