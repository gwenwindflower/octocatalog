I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/commits/d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:00:39Z"}
